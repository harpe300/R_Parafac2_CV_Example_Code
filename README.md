# R_Parafac2_CV_Example_Code

Example R code to:
1) Structure and preprocess large amounts of data into a four-way data array,
2) Conduct Parafac2 (Parallel Factor Analysis2) modeling of a four-way array to explain the maximum amount of variance in, and reduce the dimensionality of, all four modes simultaneously,
3) Use the cross-validated mean square error to decide the optimal number of factors to retain,
4) Conduct split-half analyses and calculate Tucker congruence coefficients to validate the chosen model, 
5) Visualize the raw data, 
6) Visualize the Parafac2-derived model, and
7) Conduct statistical analyses using linear mixed models to understand the real-world significance of the Parafac2 model factors.
